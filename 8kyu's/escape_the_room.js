// You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).
var rooms = {
    name : {
      first: "Dkay",
      type: "Mouka",
      model: "Sony"
    },
    bed : {
      first: "Dkay",
      type: "Mouka",
      model: "Sony"
    },
    tv : {
     first: "Dkay",
      type: "Mouka",
      model: "Sony"
    }
}
// Just created an object that has three properties and each property has three key value pairs
